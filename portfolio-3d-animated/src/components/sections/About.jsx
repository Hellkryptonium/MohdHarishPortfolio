                    Hi! I'm [Your Name], a passionate 3D artist and web developer. I love creating interactive experiences that blend art and technology.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    My journey began with a fascination for 3D modeling and animation, which led me to explore web development. Now, I combine these skills to build engaging portfolios and projects.

                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me exploring the latest trends in technology, playing video games, or enjoying the great outdoors.
